# Blackwing Lair

## Razorgore

#### Phase 1 - The Hard Part
One player Controls Razorgore (**Kinny** RG1, **Aresa** RG2)

* Raid will be split into 2 groups, one for each side of the platform
* Ranged will be on top of the platform on the side of their group
* 2 Tanks on each side
* Groups need to *COMMUNICATE* when they're getting overwhelmed. Ideally we have a healer captain on each side calling this

Adds: 
1. Mage. Highest Priority. If the spawn across the room need to be kicked and brought over.
2. Dragonspawn. High health high damage adds. Most likely to get out of control.
3. Legionnaire. Trash mob. Watch for cleave.

A **TANK** will take control of razorgore for the last egg so that he has infinity threat going into phase 2

#### Phase 2 - Tank and Spank

**Conflagarate**: Like Drak in UBRS, will disorient and drop threat on primary tank. As he is untauntable the 2nd tank will need to be 2nd on threat.

**Fireball Volley**: 
We will stack with ranged near an LOS spot, they will dip out of sight when Volley is cast. Melee just need to deal with it (Fire Protection Pots)


**NO ONE ENTER THE NEXT ROOM AFTER RAZORGORE, ELEMENTIUM ORE MOBS WILL FLEE, NEED TO BE TAGGED**

## Vaelastrasz

Melee will position on her back leg. 

#### Tanks
* Tank will get a debuff reducing their hp (Every 45 seconds ish).
* High threat gen is a must. 2nd tank needs to be right behind main tank on threat at all times
* 2nd tank must also be ready to get in tank position


#### Melee
* Positioned on her back leg, your only job is managing your threat. Do NOT pass the 2nd tank unless you're prepared to tank.
* Positioning is important, and there's no movement on this fight. Get into the melee spot and stand still

#### Ranged
* Positioned in a stack with a lane to run out.
* Periodically (approximately 15 seconds) a ranged player will get a debuff that drains their health but gives them instant cast spells. This player needs to run out of the group far away and pump as much damage as they can before dying in a blaze of glory.

## Post Vael Trash

#### Death Talon Packs

1 Captain, 4 melee mobs, 2 casters

**Captain** will need to be kited by a hunter around Vael's room. One other person needs to enter combat with the Captain so that when the hunter feigns it doesn't reset the pack.

**4 Melee Mobs** will need to be picked up by 1 tank each (4 tanks). Tanks will stack these mobs in a corner with their back to a wall (some of the mobs will do a knockup), and they will be cleaved down.

**2 Casters** will need to be chain slept by druids until the melee mobs are dead. Druids doing this should spam rank 1 hibernate on these mobs. They are very deadly if not controlled.

#### Supression Room

**Tight Stacking is very important here**. Everyone needs to be where they're supposed to be at all times.

**Whelps** will be picked up by a tank. No one else should hurt these until it is called for. Healer aggro will be the primary concern for the tank grabbing these. They will respawn quickly if killed so we will grab them as we run and AOE at the end.

**Trap Pillars** will need to be disarmed by rogues ahead of our path. We will assign 3 rogues to rotate this. Having the raid hit by these pillars is deadly.

**Warlocks** will aoe heal. Can be annoying if paired with whelps but they're easy to burn down.

**Hatchers** need to be pulled carefully by the hunters. Getting 2 of these can be a wipe. 

There are 2 levels to this room, with a staircase in between. We can be knocked back from the 2nd room back into the first so again **positioning is key**

At the end of the 2nd room, there is a boss. Careful positioning as we approach is key because he has a large aggro radius

## Broodlord

The Main tank will be dealing with a Cleave as well as a Mortal Strike that deals high damage. Healers should play around the Mortal Strike, and pre shield the tank before it comes in. 

The Main Tank will be knocked away every ~30 seconds and have their threat cut in half so the off tank will need to be ready to pick them up. **DPS will need to start slow for the first knock back**

He will also periodically aoe knockback, which the melee will be hit by.

The room to fight this boss is tight. The highest priority is not getting knocked back into any respawned trash in the suppression room leading up to this fight.

## Post Broodlord Trash - Lab Packs
* 2 Warlocks: Need to die fast to stop raid damage. Shadowbolt volleys need to be kicked. Need to dodge rain of fire.
    * Warlocks will spawn a portal after a bit that will eventually spawn a demon. This demon is a banishable tank and spank so we will save these for last
* Goblins: 7 or 8 goblins but they will always aggro the same person, they throw dynamite and poison vials
    * get threat on goblins and just run in a large circle while aoe'ing, and have a druid dispel poison
    * a ranged player can kite these goblins
* Drakonid: Highly resistant to 4 schools of magic and really weak to the last 1. Need raid to test and communicate what the weakness is
* Spellbinders: Immune to magic, melee focus after Warlocks. Will flamestrike the tank so melee should be max ranging behind them

We will assign 1 tank to each warlock, 1 tank to the Drakonid, and 1 tank to the spellbinder. Hunter(s) and Mage(s) (just a few) will help kite goblins. 

After warlocks die, melee will prioritize the Spellbinder while ranged will figure out the Drakonid's weakness and kill it. If the Drakonid is resistant to your spells then help kill the goblins.

## 3 Drakes

#### Common abilities
* Shadowflame: Frontal cone that does significant fire damage, 2sec cast, fixed timer. Healers and Tanks will need to be proactive about mitigating this.
* Thrash: Windfury effect where they hit 3 times in a row. This means the tank will take random spikes of damage.
* Wing Buffet: Threat drop and knockback on target. Ideally an off tank taunts right before this ability goes out and eats it for the main tank.

Tanks will always want their backs to a wall for these drakes to deal with wing buffet.


#### Firemaw

This is the hardest 3.

Flamegor will stack up a debuff on all targets in LOS of that increases fire damage taken and leaves a dot.

**Main Tank** will wear full fire resist gear so that this debuff drops off on its own for him.

**Healers** will stand where they can see the tank/raid but out of line of sight of the boss

**DPS** will need to periodically drop line of sight to let stacks fall off


#### Ebonroc

Ebonroc will debuff the tank which causes Ebonroc to heal when that tank is hit.

**Tanks** will loosely spread in a corner and rotate taunts on Ebonroc as this debuff/Wing Buffet comes in.

**Healers** will focus heal the tanks. No one else in the raid should take any damage.

#### Flamegor

Will constantly try to enrage.

**Hunters** will keep Flamegor permanently tranquilized.

## Chromaggus

#### Debuffs
* Will constantly afflict the raid with a variety of debuffs. 4 of these are dispellable and should be dispelled quickly.
* The 5th debuff is only dispellable with Hourglass Sand that drops within blackwing lair. This dust removes a debuff that randomly stuns the target for several seconds. Priority for distribution of this sand is Main Tank > Healer > Everyone else. If dps only get one of these sand because of short supply, they should save it for 20% when Chromaggus enrages.

#### Breaths
* Every week, Chromaggus will have access to 2 of 5 possible breaths.
* He will breath them alternating every 30 seconds.
* Everyone except the main tank will need to line of sight these breaths.
* Most of these breaths just mean the main tank will need lots of healing. THe exceptions are:
    * Frost Burn: Slows attack speed by 80% for 15 seconds. This will severely hamper threat generation
    * Time Lapse: Stuns for 6 seconds, reduces health, and halves aggro. An off tank needs to be 2nd on threat if this breath is up, so that they can tank Chromaggus for the 6 second duration.

#### Other Mechanics
**Hunters** will need to rotate Tranqs for when Chromaggus enrages throughout the fight.

At **20%** Chromaggus will permanent enrage, dealing a lot of damage. He needs to be quickly killed once he hits this phase.

**Casters** will need to pay attention for Shimmer, where Chromaggus will become weak to 1 school of magic. While he is weak it should be exploited at all costs, even if just with a wand. Ideally grab some wands for the elementals you don't have spells for.

## Nefarian

#### Phase 1 - Drakonids
During this phase, Nefarian will spawn Drakonids from 2 caves until 42 have been spwaned and killed. These Drakonids should die stacked up pretty close to where they spawn to make phase 3 easier.

We will split the raid into two groups with healers positioned between to deal with these adds.

Chromatic Drakonids have higher health and hit harder than the rest of the Drakonids. They are also highly resistant to all kinds of magic. They need to be prioritized first by all melee.

On top of the Chromatic Drakonids, 2 of 5 possible other types of Drakonids will spawn (changes each week).

* Black Drakonids are resistant to Shadow and Fire damage and deal moderate Fire attacks
* Blue Drakonids will drain Mana and lower attack speed with their attacks, and are resistant to Frost. These must be focused down as a priority over all other Drakonids (but Chromatic).
* Bronze Drakonids will increase cast speeds and reduce attack speed with their attacks and are resistance to Arcane. These can be AOE'd down.
* Green Drakonids can stun on their attacks and are resistant to Nature. These can usually be DPS'd down as a last priority, after any other Drakonids.
* Red Drakonids have a short-range Fire DOT and are resistant to Fire.

```
From Wowhead:
As a rule of thumb, Red and Bronze Drakonids should be handled by caster classes, while Black and Blue Drakonids need to be dealt with by melee/hunters. Non-Chromatic Drakonids should not live for very long, while Chromatic Drakonids will need to be properly tanked.
```

#### Phase 2 - Nefarian
At the beginning of phase 2, Nefarian will use shadowflame on the raid.

**Everyone in the raid MUST have an onyxia scale cloak equipped to survive this ability**

Tanks will pick him up where he lands and face him away from the room (out the balcony).

Dragonslayer position applies (avoid face/tail).

He will periodically curse someone (some sources say main tank, some say closest person to his hitbox) with a Mortal Strike effect that if its on a tank needs to be decursed quickly.

Every 30 seconds he will fear the raid. The ground will shake prior to this happening so it is predictable.

Finally, Every 30 seconds Nefarian will use a Class Call. These calls target a specific class and effect each one different.

Here's a list of these calls, generally ordered by how dangerous they are

* Warriors forced into zerker stance and take 30% more damage. Terrible for tanks, need heavy healing
* Priests get a debuff that makes direct heals hurt the target. Need to stop healing or use renew/PW:S
* Paladins will BOP nefarian, need to slow caster dps because tanks cant generate threat
* Mages Call, poly random raid members, needs to be dispelled quickly, or just have mages Max range  the raid on the other side of nef
* Warlocks summon infernals, need to just be killed quickly. These infernals will aoe stun on spawn.
* Druids forced into cat form, can probably just sit it out, or maybe even just run up and do dps,  but be wary of fear
* Hunter ranged weapons will break, need to unequip before class calls or bring backups
* Rogues get rooted somewhere near nefarian's face, must use CDs to survive or have tanks move nefarian to avoid cleaving rogues

Mages can stand on the opposite side of the boss from the rest of the ranged to avoid polymorphing anyone except themselves, as they shouldn't be taking any damage.

Warlocks can also stand slightly apart from the raid so they don't stun everyone when infernals spawn.

#### Phase 3 - The Finale
At 20%, Nefarian will ressurect all the dead Drakonids as Skeletons. These need to be aoe'd quickly.

Because of this, we will likely slow dps before 20% to make sure we don't get a bad class call (priest, warrior, mage) right as we transistion

The heroes of this mechanic are Paladins using Holy Wrath, Mages with Imp Blizzard, and liberal use of Stratholme holy water.

Once the adds are dead, the rest of the fight is the same as phase 2, just kill nefarian.
